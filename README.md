## Testing 


###Bugs

1- All the pages in iPhone Responsive views had a horizontal scroll bar.

Issue:

- All the rows from Bootstrap has a 'Margin-Right' and 'Margin'Left'

Solution:

- Created a target on Stylesheet for all ".row" and removed the Margin-left and "margin-right"

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


2- The Nav bar doesn't work in Responsive mode.

Issue:

- I believe the issue is related to the 'Join Us' Button

Solution:

- I dont have the time to resolve it
